==Upcoming Changes==

Changes and additions that are planned for inclusion in a future version of the library:

  * Add `deleteComment()` method, which was overlooked when adding the other Groups API methods in [ReleaseNotes#Version_3.2.0 version 3.2.0] (v.3.2.1).
  * Publish unit tests for the class.
  * Remove all deprecated methods/parameters (v4.0.0).
  * Ability for Simple-!LinkedIn to co-exist with both the stand-alone OAth class, as well as the [http://pecl.php.net/package/oauth PECL OAuth] extension, depending on which is installed (v4.0.0).
