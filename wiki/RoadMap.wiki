=Project Roadmap=

A non-binding list of future changes, thoughts, etc about the direction of the Simple-!LinkedIn class.

==Upcoming Changes==

Changes and additions that are planned for inclusion in a future version of the library:

  * Add `deleteComment()` method (missed adding this functionality with the other Groups API methods added in [ReleaseNotes#Version_3.2.0 version 3.2.0]).
  * Remove all deprecated methods/parameters (v4.0.0)
  * Ability for Simple-!LinkedIn to co-exist with both the stand-alone OAth class, as well as the PECL OAuth extension, depending on which is installed (v4.0.0).

==To Do==

Nothing at this time.

==Wish List==

  * Inclusion of the Simple-!LinkedIn library as a PECL extension.
