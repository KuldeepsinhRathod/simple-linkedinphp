This brief guide should have LinkedIn connectivity up and running in a few short minutes.

==Sign-up for a LinkedIn Application Key==

Before starting, you'll need an application token (a key pair) from LinkedIn. You can apply for a key [https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer here]; be sure to keep this key pair handy - you'll need in in a few moments.

==Downloading the Required Files==

  * Download the latest version of the script, demo scripts and support image from the '[http://code.google.com/p/simple-linkedinphp/downloads/list Downloads]' page;
  * Download the stand-alone [http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/php/ OAuth library from Google Code].

==Installing the Files== 

Once you have the needed files, unzip them and place them on your web server in a location that can be accessed by your user-facing PHP scripts.

By default, the Simple-LinkedIn class file will look for the OAuth class in the same directory - should you need to change this, simply change the following line, found near the top of the Simple-LinkedIn class file as needed:

{{{
require_once('OAuth.php');
}}}

===Verifying the Install===

As the library includes a set of demonstration scripts, once you have dropped the files on your server you can then use them to verify that communications are working.
